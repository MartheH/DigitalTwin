This Unity-based digital twin was developed as part of our bachelor project at the University of South-Eastern Norway, in collaboration with Kongsberg Discovery. 
The digital twin visualizes real-time telemetry and positioning data from an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) system and supports testing and monitoring of underwater sensor technologies.
